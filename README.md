# video-editor
A ts based video editor guessing on advanced nice reduction through frequency filleting. Will add not features as I go.

# Work Log - [Date]

## Summary
Worked on developing the video editor, focusing on noise reduction with frequency filtering. Made progress on isolating particular noise waves.

## Detailed Tasks
- Implemented a band-pass filter to isolate noise frequencies.
- Tested the filter with various noise samples to refine accuracy.
- Began integrating the noise reduction feature into the main codebase. I ♥️ open source 🇳🇵🤲🏻🔆

## Challenges
- Encountered some issues with filter performance at higher frequencies.
- Need to optimize the algorithm to reduce processing time.

## Next Steps
- Refine the band-pass filter based on test results.
- Work on optimizing the noise reduction algorithm.
- Start developing the user interface for the noise reduction feature.
