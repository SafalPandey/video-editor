# video-editor

A ts based video editor based on advanced noise reduction through targeted high speed(ns) frequency band filtering.

# operating-mantra

Will add new features as I think of them in particular order.

# milestones

## Summary

I’ve been working on the video editor, and I’m making some great progress on reducing noise. I’m focusing on frequency filtering to isolate specific noise waves. This is all driven by prediction from our S-teir algorithms. All developed in-house, @Kathmandu.

## Detailed Tasks

- Implemented a band-pass filter to isolate noise frequencies.
- Tested the filter with various noise samples to refine accuracy.
- Began integrating the noise reduction feature into the main codebase. I ♥️ open source 🇳🇵🤲🏻🔆

## Challenges

- Encountered some issues with filter performance at higher frequencies.
- Need to optimize the algorithm to reduce processing time.

## Next Steps

- Refine the band-pass filter based on test results.
- Work on optimizing the noise reduction algorithm.
- Start developing the user interface for the noise reduction feature.
